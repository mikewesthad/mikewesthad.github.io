## Overview

Encoded Objects explores how information and interactivity can augment our understandings of image & object making. These investigations re-envision our current conditions by considering the history of art and information through a technological lens. Founding members Mike Hadley and Jonathan Rockford integrate their varied experiences by merging the physical and digital realms into singular works of art.

## Coming Soon

The above piece - Bound Lines (source code) - is a digital print that visualizes 18th century ship logs and reveals the “footprints” of sailors as they explored the world.

More project documentation & Encoded Objects website coming soon.
