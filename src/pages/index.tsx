      <p>Hi, I’m Mike Hadley.</p>
      <p>
        I’m a <Link to="/">developer</Link>, <Link to="/">educator</Link> and{" "}
        <Link to="/">artist</Link> who translates creative ideas into code and teaches others how to
        do the same. My mission is to make the world of technology more accessible – both in terms
        of who has access to learning materials as well as through introducing people to the
        creative side of technology.
