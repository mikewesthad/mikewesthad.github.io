      <p>Hi, I’m Mike Hadley.</p>
      <p>
        I’m a developer, educator and artist who translates creative ideas into code and teaches
        others how to do the same. My mission is to make the world of technology more accessible –
        both in terms of who has access to learning materials as well as through introducing people
        to the creative side of technology.
      </p>
      <p>Have a creative vision that you want to bring to life? Get in touch and let’s chat.</p>
