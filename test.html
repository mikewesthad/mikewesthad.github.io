<p>This is a series of blog posts about creating modular worlds with tilemaps in the
  <a href="http://phaser.io/">Phaser 3</a> game engine. If you haven’t, check out the first
  <a href="https://medium.com/@michaelwesthadley/modular-game-worlds-in-phaser-3-tilemaps-1-958fc7e6bbd6">post</a> where we used static tilemaps to create a Pokémon-style game world. In this post, we’ll dive into dynamic tilemaps
  and create a puzzle-y platformer where you can draw platforms to help get around obstacles:</p>

<p>In the next posts in the series, we’ll create a procedural dungeon world and integrate
  <a href="http://brm.io/matter-js/">Matter.js</a> to create a wall-jumping platformer.</p>
<p>Before we dive in, all the source code and assets that go along with this post can be found in
  <a href="https://github.com/mikewesthad/phaser-3-tilemap-blog-posts/tree/master/examples/post-2">this repository</a>.</p>
<h3>Intended Audience</h3>
<p>This post will make the most sense if you have some experience with JavaScript (classes, arrow functions &amp; modules),
  Phaser and the
  <a href="https://www.mapeditor.org/">Tiled</a> map editor. If you don’t, you might want to start at the beginning of the
  <a href="https://medium.com/@michaelwesthadley/modular-game-worlds-in-phaser-3-tilemaps-1-958fc7e6bbd6">series</a>, or continue reading and keep Google, the Phaser
  <a href="https://phaser.io/tutorials/making-your-first-phaser-3-game">tutorial</a> and the Phaser
  <a href="https://labs.phaser.io/">examples</a> &amp;
  <a href="https://photonstorm.github.io/phaser3-docs/index.html">documentation</a> handy.</p>
<p>Alright, Let’s get into it!</p>
<h3>The Tilemap API</h3>
<p>Before we build the platformer, let’s start with a bird’s-eye view of the tilemap API. We talked about the following bits
  last time:</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <a href="https://photonstorm.github.io/phaser3-docs/Phaser.Tilemaps.Tilemap.html">Tilemap</a>
  </li>
  <li>
    <a href="https://photonstorm.github.io/phaser3-docs/Phaser.Tilemaps.Tileset.html">Tileset</a>
  </li>
  <li>
    <a href="https://photonstorm.github.io/phaser3-docs/Phaser.Tilemaps.StaticTilemapLayer.html">StaticTilemapLayer</a>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>In this post, we’ll dive into two new pieces of the API:</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    <a href="https://photonstorm.github.io/phaser3-docs/Phaser.Tilemaps.DynamicTilemapLayer.html">DynamicTilemapLayer</a>
  </li>
  <li>
    <a href="https://photonstorm.github.io/phaser3-docs/Phaser.Tilemaps.Tile.html">Tile</a>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>A Tilemap isn't a display object. It holds data about the map and can contain one or more layers, which are the display objects
  that actually render Tile objects. They come in two flavors: StaticTilemapLayer &amp; DynamicTilemapLayer. A StaticTilemapLayer
  is fast, but its tiles can't be modified. A DynamicTilemapLayer trades some speed for the flexibility and power of manipulating
  individual tiles.</p>
<p>Static and dynamic layers share much of the same API. They both have methods for checking whether a tile exists (e.g. hasTileAt).
  They both have methods for getting access to tiles in the map (getTileAt,findTile, forEachTile, etc.). Dynamic layers have
  a set of additional methods for adding, removing, randomizing, etc. tiles within the layer (e.g. putTileAt, removeTileAt,
  randomize, etc.).</p>
<p>The tilemap API is flexible, so you can choose the right tool for the job. You can mix static and dynamic layers together
  in the same map. You can also convert a dynamic layer into a static layer, allowing you to generate a level on the fly
  and then optimize it.</p>
<h3>Painting Tiles</h3>
<p>For the first example, we’ll load up a level made with Tiled and then paint &amp; erase tiles on the fly. We couldn’t use
  static layers here, so we’ll need to reach for dynamic layers.</p>

      <em>https://0x72.itch.io/16x16-industrial-tileset</em>
    </a>
  </figcaption>
</figure>
<p>We set up dynamic layers in the same way as static layers, except using
  <a href="https://photonstorm.github.io/phaser3-docs/Phaser.Tilemaps.Tilemap.html#createDynamicLayer__anchor">map.createDynamicLayer</a> instead of
  <a href="https://photonstorm.github.io/phaser3-docs/Phaser.Tilemaps.Tilemap.html#createStaticLayer__anchor">map.createStaticLayer</a>:</p>
<a href="https://medium.com/media/1d8e80ada47f606dc87004b654128ad0/href">https://medium.com/media/1d8e80ada47f606dc87004b654128ad0/href</a>
<p>Once you’ve got a dynamic layer loaded up, you can start manipulating tiles using the
  <a href="https://photonstorm.github.io/phaser3-docs/Phaser.Tilemaps.DynamicTilemapLayer.html">DynamicTilemapLayer API</a>:</p>
<a href="https://medium.com/media/86bd461caf54c4076d6b314bcc8144e6/href">https://medium.com/media/86bd461caf54c4076d6b314bcc8144e6/href</a>
<p>The tilemap layer (and tilemap) methods that get or manipulate tiles often come in pairs. One method — like
  <a href="https://photonstorm.github.io/phaser3-docs/Phaser.Tilemaps.DynamicTilemapLayer.html#putTileAt__anchor">putTileAt</a> - will operate on tile grid units, e.g. (0, 2) would correspond to the first column and third row of the
  layer. The other method - like
  <a href="https://photonstorm.github.io/phaser3-docs/Phaser.Tilemaps.DynamicTilemapLayer.html#putTileAtWorldXY__anchor">putTileAtWorldXY</a> - will operate in world pixel units, making it easier to do things like find which tile is under the
  mouse. There are also methods for converting from tile grid units to world pixel coordinates and vice versa:
  <a href="https://photonstorm.github.io/phaser3-docs/Phaser.Tilemaps.DynamicTilemapLayer.html#worldToTileXY__anchor">worldToTileXY</a>,
  <a href="https://photonstorm.github.io/phaser3-docs/Phaser.Tilemaps.DynamicTilemapLayer.html#tileToWorldXY__anchor">tileToWorldXY</a>.</p>
<p>Putting these methods together with Phaser input, we can draw tiles in a layer with the mouse:</p>
<a href="https://medium.com/media/94ddc41c27679c643593cf0697b7e29e/href">https://medium.com/media/94ddc41c27679c643593cf0697b7e29e/href</a>
<p>The following example puts all of this together and allows you to paint tiles by clicking and erase tiles by clicking while
  holding shift. worldToTileXY &amp; tileToWorldXY are used to create a simple graphic overlay to visualize which tile the
  mouse is currently over.</p>
<p>Note: you’ll want to click on the “Edit on CodeSandbox” button and check out the code in full screen where you can see all
  the files easily.</p>

<h3>Modularizing Our Code</h3>
<p>Adding or removing individual tiles is pretty easy, so let’s step up the complexity and build the foundations of a platformer:</p>
<figure>
  <img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/790/1*tc54eGD6Rh4-koyHhxMoGQ.gif">
</figure>
<p>Thus far, we’ve gotten up and running quickly with Phaser using a single file that has preload, setup and update functions.
  That's great for simple examples, but becomes a nightmare once you get to anything moderately complex.</p>
<p>To build our platforming foundation, we want to split up that monolithic file structure into easier-to-digest, isolated files
  called “modules.” There are a lot of reasons go modular with your code. If used well, they help create portable &amp; reusable
  chunks of code that are easier to think about. If you aren’t familiar with modules, check out the
  <a href="https://eloquentjavascript.net/10_modules.html">modules chapter</a> from
  <em>Eloquent JavaScript</em> or
  <a href="https://blog.cloud66.com/an-overview-of-es6-modules-in-javascript/">this overview</a>.</p>
<p>If you are using a modern browser (roughly anything late 2017 onward), you can use modules in your project (without needing
  webpack, parcel, etc.) by adding the type="module" attribute in your HTML like this:</p>
<a href="https://medium.com/media/e4b06e56c7ee1387cc7bcfc163289f00/href">https://medium.com/media/e4b06e56c7ee1387cc7bcfc163289f00/href</a>
<p>(Note: you won’t see this in the CodeSandbox demos since they use the
  <a href="https://parceljs.org/">Parcel bundler</a> to enable module support, but you will see it in the
  <a href="https://github.com/mikewesthad/phaser-3-tilemap-blog-posts/tree/master/examples/post-2">source code</a> for this series.)</p>
<p>Inside of index.js, you can now
  <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/import">import</a> functions, objects, or primitive values from other files that have at least one
  <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/web/javascript/reference/statements/export">export</a>. import and export provide ways for us to split our single file code into separate files. With that in mind,
  here's what our new project structure looks like:</p>
<figure>
  <img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/300/1*7jHWzPxXCLaxs2gJijrJCQ.png">
</figure>
<a href="https://medium.com/media/42cd6d8bfa5000b17c5e52d6e04ce7f1/href">https://medium.com/media/42cd6d8bfa5000b17c5e52d6e04ce7f1/href</a>
<p>Check out the code below, starting with index.js. From there, when you see an import, look at the file that's being referenced
  to follow the thread. This will be the basis we build upon for the next section.</p>
<a href="https://medium.com/media/2226eb2dc052b79479ced2dd593b97b9/href">https://medium.com/media/2226eb2dc052b79479ced2dd593b97b9/href</a>
<p>Breaking down every line of code here is a bit out of the scope of the post, but let’s look at a trimmed down version of
  player.js before moving on:</p>
<a href="https://medium.com/media/2131b7a03279a3bf9a4b5931762f502b/href">https://medium.com/media/2131b7a03279a3bf9a4b5931762f502b/href</a>
<p>This sets up an important pattern by letting us separate the bulk of the player logic from platformer-scene.js. The scene
  just has to worry about how the player interacts with the rest of the world. As long as we call updateand destroy at the
  right times, we could even bring this player file over to a completely separate project and it would work fine.</p>
<p>It’s also worth noting that this class sets up a pattern that we’ll use again in the future. player.js exports a class that
  doesn’t extend Phaser.GameObjects.Sprite. Instead, it embraces a more flexible
  <a href="http://gameprogrammingpatterns.com/component.html">component pattern</a> where Player has a sprite property rather than Player itself being a sprite.</p>
<p>There’s a lot more that we could do to make this code more modular (e.g. taking advantage of Phaser’s event system, see
  <a
    href="https://github.com/samme/phaser-plugin-update">samme/phaser-plugin-update</a>, or separating the movement logic from the animation), but this is modular enough without
  introducing too many new concepts.</p>
<h3>The Platformer</h3>
<p>Whew, we’ve got a template that we can build upon now. Let’s turn back to the idea of a platformer where you can draw tiles
  to get around obstacles:</p>
<figure>
  <img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/790/1*gDH7ngacTtHrHwvP0aZz7w.gif">
</figure>
<p>There are two important tilemap-specific extensions to the code from the previous section that we should break down:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Painting colliding tiles</li>
  <li>Adding spikes with proper hitboxes and logic</li>
</ol>
<p>First up, painting tiles. This is similar to previous code, but with the added wrinkle that we want the tiles that we add
  to be colliding, so that the player can land on them. putTileAtWorldXY will return the
  <a href="https://photonstorm.github.io/phaser3-docs/Phaser.Tilemaps.Tile">Tile</a> object that is being manipulated. Tile objects are pretty simple. They hold the index and position of the tile
  that they render, along with some physics information. We can use tile.setCollision to enable collisions:</p>
<a href="https://medium.com/media/e2ce4b09198d81e27b920af543647b44/href">https://medium.com/media/e2ce4b09198d81e27b920af543647b44/href</a>
<p>Tiles have other useful properties &amp; methods. tile.x and tile.y are the position in grid units. tile.getLeft(), tile.getBottom(),
  tile.getCenterX(), etc. will give you the position in world pixel units. Check out the
  <a href="https://photonstorm.github.io/phaser3-docs/Phaser.Tilemaps.Tile">docs</a> for more information.</p>
<p>Perfect, we can paint tiles now. But we’ve got a spike problem:</p>
<figure>
  <img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/790/1*KzPiGzqnBorKdXy_4Xd5eA.gif">
</figure>
<p>One of the arcade physics (AP) limits in Phaser is that the physics body of colliding tiles is forced to be a rectangle that
  matches the tile width and tile height. Our spike is only 6px tall, but it’s given a 32px x 32px hitbox. If we load up
  the map and render the colliding tiles using this.groundLayer.renderDebug, the issue is more apparent:</p>
<figure>
  <img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/756/1*em4wU0VMhrwblsOiciO_7g.gif">
</figure>
<p>There are a few ways to solve this. We could switch to using Matter.js for physics, but that’s overkill. Instead, let’s convert
  the spikes from tiles into sprites, which we can give custom sized physics bodies. (…which also gives us a convenient excuse
  to look deeper at the tilemap API!)</p>
<p>Tilemaps have methods for turning Tiled objects and tiles into sprites:
  <a href="https://photonstorm.github.io/phaser3-docs/Phaser.Tilemaps.Tilemap.html#createFromObjects__anchor">createFromObjects</a> &amp;
  <a href="https://photonstorm.github.io/phaser3-docs/Phaser.Tilemaps.Tilemap.html#createFromTiles__anchor">createFromTiles</a> respectively. You can these to visually lay out where your game entities should be - e.g. place Tiled
  objects where enemies should be in your level and then turn them into proper sprites when your game boots up. Here's a
  diagrammed
  <a href="https://labs.phaser.io/edit.html?src=src%5Cgame%20objects%5Ctilemap%5Cstatic%5Ccreate%20from%20objects.js&amp;v=3.9.0">Phaser example</a> that uses this strategy to replace Tiled objects with animated coin sprites:</p>
<figure>
  <img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*as6XVjmqc7YogHXJtFUPcg.gif">
  <figcaption>
    <em>The left side is the Phaser example running in the browser and the right side is Tiled. Note how width/height/flip etc.
      are copied over to the animated coin sprites.</em>
  </figcaption>
</figure>
<p>In the context of our code, turning spikes into sprites is a little more complicated, so we can roll our own custom version
  of tile → sprite logic by looping over all the Tile objects in a layer using
  <a href="https://photonstorm.github.io/phaser3-docs/Phaser.Tilemaps.DynamicTilemapLayer.html#forEachTile__anchor">forEachTile</a>:</p>
<a href="https://medium.com/media/5fa6e23800cb3b00b345fcb660bad173/href">https://medium.com/media/5fa6e23800cb3b00b345fcb660bad173/href</a>
<p>And we’ll end up with nice hitboxes like:</p>
<figure>
  <img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/756/1*Nm2nXVw5MJtCgnnSG8ERrg.gif">
</figure>
<p>Now for everything in context, where we reset the game when the player touches the spikes:</p>
<a href="https://medium.com/media/db1c5be5c1658abe947c9c85564ecfb6/href">https://medium.com/media/db1c5be5c1658abe947c9c85564ecfb6/href</a>
<h3>Up Next</h3>
<p>Stay tuned. In the next two posts in the series, we’ll create a procedural dungeon with dynamic tilemaps and integrate
  <a
    href="http://brm.io/matter-js/">Matter.js</a> to create a wall-jumping platformer.</p>

<h3>About Me</h3>
<p>I’m a creative developer &amp; educator. I wrote the Tilemap API for Phaser 3 and created a ton of guided examples, but I
  wanted to collect all of that information into a more guided and digestible format so that people can more easily jump
  into Phaser 3. You can see more of my work and get in touch
