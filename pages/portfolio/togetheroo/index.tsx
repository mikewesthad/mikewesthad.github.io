        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>
          I worked with Bart Yeary (founder, designer) to build a real-time video chat platform, 
          <Link href="https://togetheroo.com">Togetheroo</Link>. The mission was to create a
          platform that connects family members over long distance. While video chatting, users can
          open a shared play space to play kid-friendly games and other educational apps. The
          current application library includes a collaborative drawing application and a
          mix-and-match smoothie game.
        </p>
        <p>
          Development was paused in 2016, but you can open up a play space 
          <Link href="https://togetheroo.com/playspace">here</Link> and invite a friend. See the
          founder&apos;s demos and introduction videos below.
