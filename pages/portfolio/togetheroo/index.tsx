        <p>
          I worked with Bart Yeary (founder, designer) to build a real-time video chat platform, 
          <a href="https://togetheroo.com">Togetheroo</a>. The mission was to create a platform that
          connects family members over long distance. While video chatting, users can open a shared
          play space to play kid-friendly games and other educational apps. The current application
          library includes a collaborative drawing application and a mix-and-match smoothie game.
        </p>
        <p>
          Development was paused in 2016, but you can open up a play space 
          <a href="https://togetheroo.com/playspace">here</a> and invite a friend. See the
          founder&apos;s demos and introduction videos below.
