        <p>
          ofBook is an open source book about creative coding in C++ using the{" "}
          <a href="http://openframeworks.cc/">openFrameworks</a> library. It covers everything from
          getting started to iOS applications to game design. ofBook is available online as a web
          book <a href="http://openframeworks.cc/ofBook/chapters/foreword.html">here</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
          I wrote two chapters on graphics for the book.{" "}
          <a href="http://openframeworks.cc/ofBook/chapters/intro_to_graphics.html">
            Introduction to Graphics
          </a>{" "}
          is a chapter that guides the reader through the world of 2D graphics by creating complex
          forms from simple shapes.{" "}
          <a href="http://openframeworks.cc/ofBook/chapters/generativemesh.html">
            Generative Meshes
          </a>{" "}
          is a chapter about generating 3D graphics by applying simple rules to some data.
        </p>
        <p>
          I also helped develop the pipelines that convert the source material of the book into a
          formatted web book and a PDF book. See more in the the{" "}
