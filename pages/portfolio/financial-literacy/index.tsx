        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>
          As part of my role as Learning Product Developer at{" "}
          <a href="https://www.colum.edu/">Columbia College Chicago</a>, I created a series of
          digital games and tools for partner organizations. One of those partners was the{" "}
          <a href="https://www.econcouncil.org/">Economic Awareness Council</a>, a non-profit whose
          mission is equip youth with the skills needed to make economic and financial decisions. I
          designed and developed a series of serious games (JS, React) for them around financial
          literacy, which have reached thousands of Chicago youth so far.
        </p>
        <p>
          These games and tools were launched as part of &ldquo;learning playlists&rdquo; on
          financial literacy, a sequence of resources, activities and videos designed to teach
          Chicago youth important concepts like budgeting and credit.
