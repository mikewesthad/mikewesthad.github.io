        <p>
          I designed and modernized key parts of the API for the popular JS game engine Phaser
          (&gt;30K GitHub stars) as the engine moved between major versions. I produced thoroughly
          tested code with extensive JSDocs and produced 40 guided and annotated code examples for
          the engine's newsletter (example), which has &gt;8800 developers subscribed.
        </p>
        <p>
          While I was solely responsible for my parts of the API, it also meant collaborating with a
          small team of other developers in a fast moving repository.
