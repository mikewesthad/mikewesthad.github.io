        <p>
          I rebuilt and modernized Gamefroot&apos;s game editor from the ground up (TypeScript,
          Phaser game engine, React). <Link href="https://make.gamefroot.com/">Gamefroot</Link> is a
          cloud-based platform for making 2D games. It aims to make learning how to design and code
          a game as accessible and exciting as possible.
        </p>
        <p>
          Their existing web game editor was built on their own custom game engine, which had become
          a drain on their development team to maintain. They brought me in based on{" "}
          <Link href="/portfolio/phaser">my game engine work</Link> to rebuild their editor in a
          more maintainable way and add new features to their platform.
