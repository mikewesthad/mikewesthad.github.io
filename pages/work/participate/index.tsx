      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <p>
        I designed and developed a pair of serious games for educators (React, JS) that drew new
        users into the <a href="https://www.participate.com/">Participate</a> platform and helped
        existing users develop new lessons.
      </p>
      <p>
        Participate is a platform that helps organizations build online communities for
        collaboration and knowledge creation. In this collaboration, we were focused on building new
        experiences for the community of teachers around the United Nation's
        <a href="https://sdgs.un.org/goals">Sustainable Development Goals</a> (SDGs), a set of goals
        for achieving a better and more sustainable future for all.
      </p>
      <h2>Unit Planning Card Game</h2>
      <p>
        The unit planning card game helps teachers plan new units around the SDGs through picking
        cards from three decks - goals, solutions and reading/writing/math standards. Players pick
        an SDG (e.g. ending hunger) they want to address, select an idea for solution (e.g. change
        policy) and then standards (e.g. the reading standard of evaluate an argument). The app then
        generates a downloadable unit plan based on those cards that teachers can use to jumpstart
        the planning process.

      <h2>Find Your Action Plan Quiz</h2>
      <p>
        In the "Find Your Action Plan" quiz, teachers (or students) answer a series of short
        questions and then are presented with a personalized activity they can do to make a
        difference in the world (e.g. plant a pollinator garden or remix a sexist ad). Each activity
        comes with a PDF explaining how to get started and how to connect it with standards.
