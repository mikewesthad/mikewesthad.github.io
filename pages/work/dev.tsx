      <h1>Development</h1>
      <p>
        As a developer, I build web apps and game-like tools, often focused on education. Projects
        range from working on game engines intended to teach programming to digital card games for
        teachers to help them plan lessons.
      </p>
      <p>
        In my off time, I also maintain a set of open source tools on GitHub, write about
        programming and use code as my medium to produce art.
      </p>

        Below is a selection of my work. If you want to learn more, or want to know what else I've
        worked on, drop me a line.
