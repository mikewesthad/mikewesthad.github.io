      <h2>Mission Statement</h2>
      <p>
        Iâ€™m a developer, educator and artist who translates creative ideas into code and teaches
        others how to do the same. My mission is to make the world of technology more accessible â€“
        both in terms of who has access to learning materials as well as through introducing people
        to the creative side of technology.
